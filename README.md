# HomeHub-
Native MacOS client for Home Assistant dashboards and local sensors.  Work in progess
# Behind the Idea
The current homeassistant MacOS app is lacking features and integration and seems more like an after thought. This app currently adds native lcoaiton, battery percentage, state and charging or not. I hope to add more feature in the future
